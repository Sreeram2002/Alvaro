(1) INSPIRATION
	 Drastic increase of rapes , abduction and violation of basic human rigts .
   
   
   
(2) WHAT IT DOES ?
	: When the 2 SOS buttons are pressed simultaneously for a time period , emergency calls are sent from the phone , location is detected and sent, audio and video are recorded .
  
  
  
  
(3) HOW WE BUILT IT ?
	: * Product is designed as a detachable buckle with 2 SOS button mounted on the top and bottom faces . 
	  * When both the button are pressed simultaneously for a time of 3 seconds , the paired smart phone send emergency calls , track live location 
	    and allow access for audio and video recording through phone .
	  * TWILIO API is used to make calls .
	  * Weapon holder is also given in case of extreme situation .
    
    
    
    
(4) CHALLENGES FACED 
	: One of the major challenges was to make the buckle compact . First the plan was to attach audio and video module to the buckle . This  made the buckle heavy and boxy . So it was decided to make use of these features by pairing with smart phone .
  
  
  
(5) ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
	: We are proud that we had come up with an essential idea to prevent rapes , abduction and violation of basic human rights . This give an  individual , courage to move anywhere they want  . This will also create a fear among the criminals/perverts who   even dare to think about rapes , abduction etc 
  
  .
(6)  What we have learned
	  We created CAD models and code in a short time with the help of all the team members . This project had helped us to think about multiple ways to   trap the criminals and  bring them before the law 
    
    
(7) BUILT WITH 
	: * Auto desk fuson-360 .
	  * Git hub .
